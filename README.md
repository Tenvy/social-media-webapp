## Introduction
This website is a social media web application created for my school project using Next.js. It allows users to connect, share updates, and interact with friends online. I initiated this project to explore modern web development techniques and to build a platform for social engagement.

I developed this project using Next.js for server-side rendering on the frontend and backend, Prisma for my ORM, and tailwind for flexible styling.
