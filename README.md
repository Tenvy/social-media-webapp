## Introduction
This website is a social media web application where users can connect, share updates, and interact with friends online. I started this project to explore modern web development techniques and create a platform for social engagement.

I built the project using React for the frontend, incorporating tools like Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, and styled-components for flexible styling.
